### __Please have a look at the [Wiki](https://github.com/cyberblast/screeps.behaviour-action-pattern/wiki)!__

There are several parallel topics evolving. You can find them at [Projects](https://github.com/ScreepsGamers/screeps.behaviour-action-pattern/projects).

Please feel free to participate in any topic you like to.

We are also forming an ingame player alliance, the Open Collaboration Society (OCS). It's not a mandatory requirement to join the alliance when using this code or to participate in its development. But of course we are happy about every new member!
Please contact one of the alliance members if you want to join the alliance.
